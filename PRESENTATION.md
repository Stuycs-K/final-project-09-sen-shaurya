# Presentation
My Final project is a language interpreter for the esoteric programming language Folders: \
Folders is an esoteric programming language created by Daniel Temkin https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/Folders \
An [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design. These can be made as softare art, proof of concept, or just as a joke however the creators of these languages don't typically intend for them to be used mainstream.

### 1. Folders language explanation
(From Daniel Temkin's Site)[https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/Folders]:
Folders is a language where the program is encoded into a directory structure. All files within are ignored, as are the names of the folders. Commands and expressions are encoded by the pattern of folders within folders. 

Here are the rules of the Folders language:
#### Folders Commands
| Command | # of Folders |                                  Details                                  |
|:-------:|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| if      | 0 folders    | Second sub-folder holds expression, third holds list of commands          |
| while   | 1 folder     | Second sub-folder holds expression, third holds list of commands          |
| declare | 2 folders    | Second sub-folder holds type, third holds var name (in number of folders) |
| let     | 3 folders    | Second holds var name (in number of folders), third holds expression      |
| print   | 4 folders    | Second sub-folder holds expression                                        |
| input   | 5 folders    | Second sub-folder holds var name                                          |

#### Folders Expressions
|      Type     | # of folders |                                                               Details                                                               |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Variable      | 0 folders    | Second sub-folder holds var name                                                                                                    |
| Add           | 1 folder     | Second sub-folder holds first expression to add, third holds second expression                                                      |
| Subtract      | 2 folders    | Second sub-folder holds first expression to subtract, third holds second expression                                                 |
| Multiply      | 3 folders    | Second sub-folder holds first expression to multiply, third holds second expression                                                 |
| Divide        | 4 folders    | Second sub-folder holds first expression to divide, third holds second expression                                                   |
| Literal Value | 5 folders    | Second sub-folder holds the type of the value (eg two folders for a string, third holds the value                                   |
| Equal To      | 6 folders    | Second and third folders hold expressions to compare                                                                                |
| Greater Than  | 7 folders    | Second and third folders hold expressions to compare (returns true if the second folder holds a larger value than the third folder) |
| Less Than     | 8 folders    | Second and third folders hold expressions to compare                                                                                |

#### Folders Data Types
|  Type  | # of Folders |                                       Details                                       |
|:------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| int    | 0 folders    | Second sub-folder holds var name                                                    |
| float  | 1 folder     | Second sub-folder holds first expression to add, third holds second expression      |
| string | 2 folders    | Second sub-folder holds first expression to subtract, third holds second expression |
| char   | 3 folders    | Second sub-folder holds first expression to multiply, third holds second expression |

### 2. Write and test Hello World Program ( in video only )
### 3. Write and test input/adding Program ( in video only )
### 4. How is the interpreter organized?
There are two main parts, the `Lexer` and the `compiler`. The lexer takes in a Path to the root of the folders program. It will then walk through all of the subdirectories in the program and create a tokens list. This Tokens list is passed off to the Compiler which uses this list of tokens to create working python code that can be executed.
Tokens are basic elements that are common to programming languages such as keywords operators and expressions.
A Token list for the adding two numbers program looks like the following:
`[<INPUT : var0>, <INPUT : var0>, ... ]`
The compiled code will look like the following
```
var0 = input()
var0 = int(var0) if var0.isnumeric() else var0
...
```
You can see that the first token in the list of tokens directly matches with the first two lines of code in the compiled code. This is because the compiler goes through the tokens list and directly replaces tokens with their python code equivalents.


### 5. Relation to Cybersecurity
The cool thing about a lot of these esoteric programming languages is that they act like encoding computer instructions. With the Folders language you can hide executable code within your file structure!
Also something interesting is that on windows, folders don't count towards storage used (although technically they do take up space) so you can actually hide code in downloadables you send to people and chances are they wouldnâ€™t even notice. You might see how this technique could be used to embed malware among other seemingly harmless files, in popular github repos for example.
